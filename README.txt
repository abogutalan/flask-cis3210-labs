How it works? 💻 
- Once you run the project by following the steps below and 
you have a firefox open with the project, you will see four 
buttons e.g. GET, Submit, POST, DELETE buttons.
All of these buttons send AJAX request to python FLASK.

🤜  GET button: gets the password of the username from database.
You only need to punch a username in and click submit button.
then prints them in a paragraph html tag.

🤜  SUBMIT button: Creates a new user in the database by the values 
of username and password inputs of sign up form. 
Input boxes have to be filled in.

🤜 PUT button: Updates the password of the user in database, 
so after creating a new user, you can change password input of 
the user  and click PUT button above then see the updated password 
of the user on the screen.

🤜 DELETE button: Deletes user in database by username.

🥊  Note: There is no function of navigation bar at the top and 
Remember me check box yet.
Furthermore, you may see most of the actions on firefox console.

- Clicking my name in the footer routes to my linkedIn account,
and my student number routes to my github account.

MY NOTES:

> export FLASK_APP=app.py

Run command in the server:
> flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=19732

Run command locally:
> python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=19732

See on the browser for school server:

See on the local browser:

Seeing the processes:
> ps

Killing a process:
> kill -9 PID
