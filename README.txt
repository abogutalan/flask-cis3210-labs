How it works?
- Once you run the project by following the steps below and 
you have a firefox open with the project, you will see four 
buttons e.g. GET, PUT, POST, DELETE buttons and a submit form.
All of these buttons send AJAX request to python FLASK.

GET button: gets the username and password of a default user,
then prints them in a paragraph html tag.

POST button: Submit button below is being used instead

SUBMIT button: Creates a new user by the values of username and
password inputs of sign up form. Input boxes have to be filled in.

PUT button: Updates the information of the user by using the
values of username and password input, so after creating a new 
user, you can change username and password input and click PUT
button above then see the updated information of the user on
the screen.

DELETE button: In order to simulate deleting information of
the user i assigned empty string to username and password
variables of the user, then print the result on the screen .

Note: There is no function of navigation bar at the top and 
Remember me check box yet.
Furthermore, you may see most of the actions on firefox console.

- Clicking my name in the footer routes to my linkedIn account,
and my student number routes to my github account.
